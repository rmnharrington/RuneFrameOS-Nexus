### **Key Objectives**
- **Agent Communication**: Secure, real-time agent-to-agent communication
- **RuleSmithAI Foundation**: Establish the foundation for intelligent agent orchestration
- **Context Distribution**: Distributed context management across agents
- **Intelligent Routing**: Smart message routing and agent discovery
- **Scalable Architecture**: Enterprise-scale agent communication infrastructure
