## **Overview**

This document provides a comprehensive mapping of SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (TSC) to RuneFrameOS implementation. It defines audit evidence requirements, control testing procedures, and compliance monitoring for each TSC category.

**Document Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-07  
**Framework**: SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria (2017)  
**Scope**: RuneFrameOS Platform and App Ecosystem  

## **SOC 2 Framework Overview**

SOC 2 is an attestation framework that evaluates and reports on controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. The framework consists of:

1. **Common Criteria (CC)**: Foundational criteria that apply to all SOC 2 reports
2. **Trust Services Criteria (TSC)**: Additional criteria for specific trust services
3. **Points of Focus**: Specific considerations for each criterion

## **Compliance Matrix Structure**

Each criterion is mapped with:
- **Criterion ID**: SOC 2 criterion identifier
- **Description**: Criterion description
- **RuneFrameOS Implementation**: Platform-level controls and implementation
- **Evidence Requirements**: Documentation and artifacts needed for audit
- **Testing Procedures**: Control testing and validation procedures
- **Compliance Status**: Current implementation status
- **Audit Readiness**: Preparation status for external audit
