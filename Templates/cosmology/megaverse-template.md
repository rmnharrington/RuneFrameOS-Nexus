# **Megaverse Template**

### **1. Megaverse Designation**

The name or code for the entire collection of universes.

* **Alias/Other Names:** (e.g., The Yggdrasil Cluster, The Great Wheel, The Quantum Foam)

### **2. CNC**

The unique root code for the megaverse. This is the highest-level parent in the hierarchy.

* *Example: AEON*

### **3. Cosmological Principle**

The fundamental theory explaining the nature of this megaverse.

* *Examples: M-theory Brane Worlds, Divine Dream Construct, Causal Loop, Digital Simulation*

### **4. The Bulk**

A description of the higher-dimensional space between the Verse-branes.

* **Environment:** \[e.g., Void-like, Turbulent energy sea, Crystalline substrate, Living tissue\]  
* **Hazards:** \[e.g., Chronitonic storms, Reality-shear currents, Mega-fauna (Bulk Whales)\]

### **5. Inter-Universal Travel**

The known methods for traversing the Bulk and entering different Verses.

* **Technology:** \[e.g., Brane-Resonance Drives, Reality Anchors, Bulk Submarines\]  
* **Magic/Psionics:** \[e.g., Plane Shift rituals, The Path of the Wanderer (psionic technique)\]  
* **Accessibility:** \[e.g., Common, Extremely Rare, Theoretical, Forbidden\]

### **6. Known Universes**

A list of the primary or discovered Universe CNCs that exist within this megaverse.

* AEON.U001\[...\]  
* AEON.U734\[...\]

### **7. Tags**

* *Examples: Hard Science, Fantasy Cosmology, Horror, Exploration-Focused*

## **Example: The AEON Megaverse**

### **1. Megaverse Designation**
**AEON** - The Eternal Cycle

* **Alias/Other Names:** The Great Wheel, The Eternal Spiral, Reality-0

### **2. CNC**
**AEON**

### **3. Cosmological Principle**
**M-theory Brane Worlds with Divine Resonance**

The AEON megaverse operates on a hybrid model combining string theory brane cosmology with divine intervention. Each universe exists as a vibrating membrane (brane) within the higher-dimensional Bulk, but these branes are not purely physicalâ€”they are also metaphysical constructs shaped by divine will and cosmic resonance.

### **4. The Bulk**
* **Environment:** A vast, turbulent sea of pure potentiality, appearing as an infinite void filled with swirling energies of creation and destruction. The Bulk itself seems to "breathe" with a slow, rhythmic pulse that affects all universes within it.
* **Hazards:** Reality-shear currents that can tear apart unprepared vessels, Chronitonic storms that distort time itself, and massive entities known as Bulk Whales that occasionally breach into individual universes.

### **5. Inter-Universal Travel**
* **Technology:** Brane-Resonance Drives that can "tune" a vessel to match the specific vibrational frequency of a target universe. Reality Anchors provide stable points for navigation.
* **Magic/Psionics:** The Path of the Wanderer, a psionic technique that allows consciousness to traverse the Bulk without physical vessels. Divine intervention can create temporary bridges between universes.
* **Accessibility:** Extremely rare, requiring either advanced technology or powerful magic/psionics. Most travel is accidental or divinely guided.

### **6. Known Universes**
* AEON.U001\[0,0,0|1.0,0.0,3.0\] - The Prime Material (baseline reality)
* AEON.U734\[117,45,982|1.21,9.8,3.1\] - The Aetherial Expanse (high-magic universe)
* AEON.U999\[999,999,999|0.5,15.0,4.0\] - The Void Between (psionic-dominant reality)

### **7. Tags**
* Hard Science, Fantasy Cosmology, Divine Intervention, Exploration-Focused, High-Magic Variants
