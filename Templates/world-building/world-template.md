# World Template

## 1. World Name
Enter the name of the planet, realm, or dimensional body. This can be a linguistic construct, mythic name, or scientific designation.

## 2. World Type
Choose or describe the nature of the world (e.g., Terrestrial, Gas Giant, Hollow World, Ringworld, Shard World, Floating Isles, Discworld, Artificial Construct).

## 3. Size and Scale
- **Diameter (km/miles):** Specify planetary diameter. Can be approximate if using narrative scale (e.g., "Half the size of Earth").
- **Gravity (Relative to Earth):** Is gravity lighter, heavier, or equivalent? Use a decimal or description (e.g., 0.8g, 1.2g, "crushing").
- **Surface Area (Optional):** Used if modeling climates or geographies more precisely.

## 4. Atmosphere & Density
- **Atmospheric Composition:** List major gases. Include whether it's breathable to humans or other races.
- **Density or Thickness:** Thin, Normal, Dense, Toxic, or numerical pressure data (e.g., "1.3 atm").

## 5. Suns and Moons
- **Number of Suns:** State number and types of stars (e.g., single yellow sun, binary system, red giant + white dwarf).
- **Number of Moons:** List names and special features. Note size, orbit patterns, or magical effects.

## 6. Time and Calendar
- **Length of Day (in Hours):** How long is one full rotation? Adjust if days/nights are longer or shorter than Earth.
- **Length of Year (in Days):** How many days in one full orbit around the sun(s)?
- **Local Calendar System:** Describe how time is measured culturally. Include months, weeks, seasons, holidays, or cycles. Ex: "13 moons per year, each 28 days; holy days every solstice."

## 7. Magical or Cosmic Cycles
Optional. Define if magic, seasons, or power ebbs and flows with celestial patterns (e.g., "magic peaks during blood moon" or "sunlight wards off undead").

## 8. World History (Summary)
Provide a 1–2 paragraph overview of the world's historical arc: origin myth, great empires, collapses, divine interventions, major wars, etc.

## 9. Timeline (Bullet Format)
List key events chronologically. Include years (local calendar or common reckoning) and a short label for each.
Example:
- Year 0 — The Sundering of Vharnak
- Year 403 — Founding of the Moonlight Concord
- Year 1221 — Arrival of the Second Sun

## 10. Major Regions
List named regions, continents, or districts. Each should include a one-line descriptor.
Example:
- Thirellan Expanse – Endless salt plains haunted by wind spirits
- Blackroot Vale – Forest realm ruled by entropic druids
- Zan-Ra Archipelago – Floating islands held aloft by a dying god

## 11. Geopolitical or Cultural Zones (Optional)
Describe civilizations, factions, or empires. May overlap with regions or be layered on top of them.

## 12. Unique Planetary Traits
List 3–10 traits that make this world distinctive. Mix physical, magical, or metaphysical attributes.
Examples:
- The planet sings when struck by solar wind
- Weather is governed by the moods of sleeping titans
- Gravity reverses at midnight for one hour
- Magic is stronger near fault lines of reality
- Everyone is born with a glowing mark that fades over time

## 13. Tagging & Categorization (Optional)
Add tags for sorting: genre, tone, tech level, dominant species, climate (e.g., "Sci-Fantasy, High Magic, Pre-Industrial, Dragon-Ruled").
