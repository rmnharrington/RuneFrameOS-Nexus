Potion Difficulty Levels
The difficulty of crafting a potion depends on three main factors: ingredients, workspace, and technique. These combine into an overall challenge level.

1. Complexity of Ingredients
Each ingredient has an intrinsic difficulty score based on its rarity, preparation needs, and stability.

Ingredient Rarity
Complexity Score
Examples
Common (Level 1)
1
Basilwort, Ironbark Sap
Uncommon (Level 2)
2
Moonthorn Berries, Sparkroot
Rare (Level 3)
3
Aetherlily, Drakescale Fungus
Very Rare (Level 4)
5
Starlight Dew, Blazeheart Ore
Legendary (Level 5)
8
Golden Sunflower, Void Essence
Singular (Level 6)
10
Eternal Aether Pearl, Jah’zirahn Blood Pheromone


2. Number of Ingredients
The more ingredients used, the more complex the potion becomes. Potions must contain between 3 and 10 ingredients; exceeding 10 causes catastrophic effects.

Ingredients
Complexity Multiplier
3–4
x1
5–6
x1.5
7–8
x2
9–10
x3

Example: A potion with 6 ingredients, including 2 Rare and 1 Very Rare ingredient, would have a base difficulty score of:
(2 x 3) + (1 x 5) = 11 (base score) x 1.5 = 16.5 difficulty.

3. Workspace
The environment significantly impacts the alchemical process. Each workspace offers advantages or disadvantages depending on its size, tools, and stability.

Workspace Type
Difficulty Modifier
Features
Field Workspace
+5
Minimal tools, unstable environment
Basic Workshop
+3
Limited equipment, stable location
Advanced Laboratory
0
Fully equipped, with specialized tools
Master’s Laboratory
-5
Legendary tools, controlled magical environments


4. Techniques
Certain alchemical techniques can reduce difficulty but require skill and time to master. Techniques are chosen during potion preparation and affect specific potion properties.

Technique
Effect
Example Applications
Infusion
Reduces ingredient complexity by 1 per rare ingredient (1-time use).
Healing potions, Elemental elixirs
Distillation
Reduces total difficulty by 10%, but doubles crafting time.
High-purity potions, Elixirs of Clarity
Fermentation
Enhances potency, increasing effects but adds +2 difficulty.
Toxic potions, Endurance draughts
Catalysis
Balances volatile ingredients, reducing catastrophic risks.
Explosive or unstable mixtures.
Aetheric Binding
Amplifies magical components but adds +5 difficulty.
Mana restoration, Void elixirs



Potion Crafting Example: Elixir of Fireheart
Potion Overview
Name: Elixir of Fireheart
Effect: Grants the imbiber fire resistance and a temporary strength boost.
Ingredients (Rarity and Value): 
Blazeheart Ore (Very Rare, 5)
Drakescale Fungus (Rare, 3)
Sparkroot (Uncommon, 2)
Starlight Dew (Very Rare, 5)
Number of Ingredients: 4
Workspace: Basic Workshop (+3 modifier to difficulty)
Technique Used: Catalysis (-2 to instability risk; does not affect crafting difficulty)
Difficulty Calculation
The base difficulty is determined by summing the values of all ingredients, then applying modifiers for the number of ingredients and the workspace.
Sum of ingredient values: 5 (Blazeheart Ore) + 3 (Drakescale Fungus) + 2 (Sparkroot) + 5 (Starlight Dew) = 15 (base difficulty)
Ingredient count modifier: +1 (4 ingredients × 1 multiplier)
Workspace modifier: +3 (Basic Workshop)
Total Crafting Difficulty: 15 + 1 + 3 = 19

Failure and Catastrophic Effects
When a crafting roll fails to meet the difficulty threshold, consult the following table based on how far below the threshold the roll lands:

Margin Below Threshold
Failure Type
Example Effects
0–5
Minor Setback
Reduced potency (e.g., weaker or shorter-duration effects).
6–10
Serious Failure
Unstable potion (e.g., unpredictable side effects or spoilage).
11+
Catastrophic Event
Explosion, poisonous fumes, or other hazardous outcomes.

Additional Note on Catastrophic Effects: For potions requiring 10+ ingredients, failures can escalate to severe consequences, such as area-wide explosions, magical anomalies, or the unintended summoning of planar entities. (Not applicable to this example, as it uses only 4 ingredients.)

Difficulty Scaling by Alchemist Proficiency
Alchemists of varying skill levels can attempt potions up to certain difficulties. Use this as a guideline for balancing encounters and player progression:
Beginner Alchemist: Capable of crafting Level 1–2 potions (difficulty ≤ 10).
Intermediate Alchemist: Capable of crafting Level 3–4 potions (difficulty ≤ 20).
Master Alchemist: Capable of crafting Level 5–6 potions (difficulty ≤ 30).
