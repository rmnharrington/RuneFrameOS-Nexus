        "role": "Plays vital role in fire-aligned ecosystem, where it acts as catalyst for fire-based creatures and magic; it is believed that coal sustains fire spirits or elementals in region, giving them power to control and shape fire; presence of Everburn Coal in area often correlates with growth of fire-aligned plants and creatures",
        "propagation": "Does not reproduce in traditional sense; instead, it forms over time through gradual accumulation of magical fire energy; coal is often found in volcanic or heavily magical regions, where intense fire magic or natural flame sources constantly feed coal with energy",
        "sustainability": "Not considered endangered, but it is finite resource; over-harvesting could lead to depletion of coal deposits, which would disrupt local elemental forces and affect balance of fire magic in region"
