Alchemy System: Complexity Levels
Alchemy is a discipline of both precision and rarity. The complexity of creating potions, elixirs, and transmutations is determined by the rarity and difficulty of obtaining the ingredients. Each level represents an escalating challenge in harvesting and utilizing the materials.

Level 1: Common (Weekly Availability)
Description:
Level 1 compounds and plants are easily accessible and can often be found in local environments. These are the building blocks of alchemy, used in simple potions, salves, and elixirs.
Harvest Frequency: Weekly
Examples:
Basilwort: A common herb used for minor healing potions.
Ironbark Sap: A basic compound for reinforcing durability in potions.
Applications:
Basic healing potions, antidotes for mild poisons, and minor physical enhancements.

Level 2: Uncommon (Monthly Availability)
Description:
Level 2 materials require more effort to obtain, whether due to limited growth cycles or specific environmental needs. These are key ingredients for intermediate-level alchemical creations.
Harvest Frequency: Monthly
Examples:
Moonthorn Berries: A fruit that grows only under full moonlight, used for clarity-enhancing elixirs.
Sparkroot: A plant that grows near volcanic vents, essential for fire-resistance potions.
Applications:
Moderate healing potions, basic elemental resistance brews, and simple poisons.

Level 3: Rare (Quarterly Availability)
Description:
Level 3 ingredients are tied to seasonal or regional cycles, making them much harder to acquire. These compounds form the core of advanced alchemical recipes.
Harvest Frequency: Quarterly
Examples:
Aetherlily: A glowing flower that blooms only on the solstices.
Drakescale Fungus: Found only in the nesting grounds of specific predators.
Applications:
Potions of moderate elemental manipulation, advanced healing, or vitality restoration.

Level 4: Very Rare (Bi-Annual Availability)
Description:
Level 4 components are difficult to find and harvest, often requiring specific events or alignment of conditions. They are critical for powerful alchemical creations.
Harvest Frequency: Bi-Annually
Examples:
Starlight Dew: Collected from the leaves of specific plants during meteor showers.
Blazeheart Ore: A mineral that crystallizes only during volcanic eruptions.
Applications:
High-tier potions that grant temporary magical abilities, significant strength enhancements, or long-term effects.

Level 5: Legendary (Yearly Availability)
Description:
Level 5 ingredients are near-mythical, harvested under rare celestial or environmental circumstances. These are the pinnacle of alchemical rarity and power.
Harvest Frequency: Yearly
Examples:
Golden Sunflower: A plant that blooms once per year at the dawn of the summer solstice.
Void Essence: Harvested during a solar eclipse at a sacred leyline.
Applications:
Legendary potions with near-permanent effects, such as life extension, elemental mastery, or unmatched combat prowess.

Level 6: Singular (Once-in-a-Lifetime)
Description:
Level 6 materials are so rare that an alchemist may only encounter them once in their lifetime. These substances are the heart of legendary alchemical feats and often drive epic quests.
Harvest Frequency: Singular (extreme rarity)
Examples:
Eternal Aether Pearl: Formed at the convergence of aetheric planes, appearing only once in an epoch.
Jah’zirahn Blood Pheromone: The undiluted essence of a mature Jah’zirahn, harvested during a sandstorm when the creature emerges to hunt.
Applications:
Creation of the Philosopher’s Stone or equivalent, elixirs of true immortality, or unparalleled magical artifacts.

Implementation in Gameplay
Ingredient Rarity Drives Difficulty:
Higher-level compounds not only require greater effort to find but also necessitate superior tools, techniques, and sometimes the cooperation of entire teams or factions.
Quest and Story Hooks:
Level 1-3: Routine gathering or localized adventures.
Level 4-5: Epic quests requiring tracking, research, and significant resource investment.
Level 6: Legendary storylines spanning continents or lifetimes, forming the climax of an alchemical career.
Cost and Value:
Ingredients at each level escalate in value exponentially, making them a target for black markets, rival alchemists, and unscrupulous nobles.
