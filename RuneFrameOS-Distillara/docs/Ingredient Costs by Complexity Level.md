Ingredient Costs by Complexity Level
Each ingredient's cost is based on its rarity, availability, and the skill required to harvest or prepare it. Here's a tiered breakdown:
Level 1: Common (Weekly Availability)
Cost Range: 1–10 copper coins
Market Examples:
A pouch of Basilwort sells for 5 copper at local apothecaries.
A vial of Ironbark Sap fetches 10 copper due to slight processing.
Reasoning: These are everyday ingredients that can be foraged or cultivated with minimal skill and risk, ensuring affordability for apprentice alchemists.
Notes: Typically sold in bulk or by general merchants.

Level 2: Uncommon (Monthly Availability)
Cost Range: 5–50 copper coins (up to 1 silver for bulk)
Market Examples:
A small bundle of Moonthorn Berries costs 25 copper due to its lunar harvesting conditions.
A pouch of Sparkroot commands 50 copper due to its hazardous volcanic environment.
Reasoning: Availability is limited by natural cycles or specific environmental factors, requiring more effort or skill to harvest.
Notes: Intermediate alchemists may begin seeking these to craft specialized potions.

Level 3: Rare (Quarterly Availability)
Cost Range: 1–5 silver coins
Market Examples:
A single Aetherlily Bloom costs 2 silver, tied to solstice-only blooms.
A jar of Drakescale Fungus is priced at 5 silver, reflecting the dangers of predator nests.
Reasoning: Seasonality, regional scarcity, and higher demand drive up the price, making these ingredients a valuable commodity for skilled alchemists.
Notes: Often found in exclusive markets or directly through guild networks.

Level 4: Very Rare (Bi-Annual Availability)
Cost Range: 5–20 silver coins (up to 2 gold for processed forms)
Market Examples:
A flask of Starlight Dew costs 10 silver, with spikes during meteor showers.
A shard of Blazeheart Ore fetches 20 silver due to its volcanic origins.
Reasoning: Rare environmental phenomena or dangerous harvesting conditions make these ingredients a luxury item, often controlled by guilds or influential figures.
Notes: Often smuggled or auctioned in limited batches.

Level 5: Legendary (Yearly Availability)
Cost Range: 1–10 gold coins
Market Examples:
A single petal of the Golden Sunflower is priced at 5 gold, often doubling in ceremonial contexts.
A vial of Void Essence sells for 10 gold, though black markets can push the price even higher.
Reasoning: Yearly availability and extraordinary properties make these ingredients both rare and extremely valuable.
Notes: Highly regulated, often sold only to trusted or proven alchemists.

Level 6: Singular (Once-in-a-Lifetime)
Cost Range: 50+ gold coins (priceless)
Market Examples:
An Eternal Aether Pearl could fetch 100 gold or more at a royal auction.
Jah’zirahn Blood Pheromone is priceless, often bartered for kingdoms or favors rather than sold.
Reasoning: These materials are considered the pinnacle of alchemical rarity, often tied to myths, legends, or life-changing events.
Notes: Typically the centerpiece of epic quests and not easily valued in coin alone.

Market Dynamics
Guild-Driven Pricing:
Alchemical guilds control trade and pricing, particularly for Levels 3–6.
Guilds may impose restrictions on sales, requiring licenses or testing before allowing purchases.
Seasonal Variance:
Example: In years of fewer meteor showers, Starlight Dew prices could double or triple.
Some regions may offer discounts or bulk deals during harvest seasons to clear stock.
Black Market Influence:
High-level ingredients like Void Essence or Blazeheart Ore often appear in underground auctions or secret exchanges.
Risk factors, including legal penalties, drive prices higher.
Bartering Economy:
Legendary and Singular-level items are rarely purchased outright:
Example: An alchemist may offer a crafted Elixir of True Sight or exclusive research notes for a shard of Golden Sunflower.
Powerful nobles or rulers may sponsor expeditions to procure these items in exchange for loyalty or services.
