### Overview of RuneFrame OS
Based on the content from the RuneFrame OS website, this appears to be a digital platform designed as a modular ecosystem for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). It emphasizes seamless integration of homebrew rule systems, cross-platform compatibility (including mobile optimization), and tools like an AI assistant (RuleSmith™) for real-time rule interpretation, campaign continuity, inventory management (Hoardwell™), economy simulation (Mercatrix™), and more. The target audience spans veteran gamers and newcomers, with a focus on digital-first experiences that bridge physical and digital play.

While the site doesn't explicitly detail the technical backend, inferred database needs include:
- **User data storage**: Profiles, preferences, permissions (e.g., AI toggling and "Hard Walls"), and authentication for cross-device sync.
- **Game and content management**: Storing rule systems, homebrew adaptations, campaign histories, inventories, economies, and dynamic AI memories.
- **Scalability considerations**: Handling multi-user interactions, real-time updates (e.g., AI adjustments), and potential growth from partnerships (e.g., adding third-party game systems).
- **Performance requirements**: Efficient querying for complex data (e.g., rule interpretations, balances), low latency for mobile access, and reliability for continuity in long-running campaigns.

As a self-funded startup, the focus should be on cost-effective solutions that minimize upfront and ongoing expenses. Free open-source options are prioritized, with an eye toward permissive licenses that allow flexibility without forcing unwanted obligations (e.g., no AGPL-style requirements that could mandate sharing proprietary code in a SaaS model). Since the RuneFrame team plans to contribute to the community, databases with strong open-source ecosystems are ideal, enabling easy forking, patching, and upstream contributions.

### Assessment of Database Options
I evaluated popular databases based on cost (favoring zero commercial fees), performance (query speed, scalability, and handling of structured/unstructured data), license/EULA implications (ensuring no hidden restrictions for commercial use or cloud deployment), and suitability for RuneFrame's needs (e.g., relational for structured game rules vs. NoSQL for flexible homebrew content). Options are limited to mature, widely adopted choices to reduce risk for a small team.

|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL    | PostgreSQL License (permissive, similar to BSD/MIT; no copyleft requirements, full commercial freedom, easy to modify and contribute back). | Completely free; no licensing fees. Self-host on cheap VPS (~$5-10/month for starters). | Excellent for complex queries, ACID compliance, JSONB support for semi-structured data; scales well with indexing and extensions. Handles high concurrency for multi-user games. | High: Ideal for structured data like rules/inventories and flexible JSON for homebrew. Community contributions are straightforward (e.g., via extensions). Supports real-time features with extensions like TimescaleDB for campaign histories. |
| MariaDB       | GPL v2 (copyleft; requires sharing modifications if distributed, but fine for internal use; community fork of MySQL, avoiding Oracle control). | Completely free; similar hosting costs to PostgreSQL. | Solid for relational workloads, good read/write speeds; lighter than PostgreSQL for simpler setups but less feature-rich for advanced analytics. | Medium-High: Good if team prefers MySQL syntax. Suitable for user/game data; contributes to open-source via MariaDB Foundation. Less JSON flexibility than PostgreSQL. |
| MySQL         | GPL v2 (similar to MariaDB, but owned by Oracle; potential future restrictions, though none currently; some community wariness due to Oracle's history). | Completely free for open-source edition; enterprise features cost extra (avoidable). | Comparable to MariaDB; efficient for high-traffic reads but can bottleneck on writes without tuning. | Medium: Works for core needs but avoid due to Oracle ownership—less community-friendly for contributions compared to forks. |
| MongoDB       | SSPL (not OSI-approved open source; requires sharing all code if used in a service, even proprietary parts; designed to push users to paid Atlas cloud). | Free for self-hosted, but EULA limits SaaS without open-sourcing everything; hosting ~$5-10/month. | Fast for flexible schemas and large-scale writes; good for document-based data like homebrew rules. | Medium-Low: Flexible for unstructured game content, but EULA risks (e.g., if RuneFrame goes SaaS) make it less ideal. Community contributions possible but tied to MongoDB Inc.'s ecosystem. |
| SQLite        | Public domain (most permissive; no restrictions whatsoever).                       | Completely free; embedded, so no server costs if used locally. | Extremely lightweight and fast for single-user/low-concurrency; not designed for multi-user backends. | Low: Great for local/mobile app storage (e.g., offline campaigns), but insufficient for server-side sync or multi-device access without additional layers. |

Key takeaways from the assessment:
- **Cost weighting**: All options are free for self-hosting, but avoid anything with paid tiers (e.g., MongoDB's Atlas push) or potential future fees (e.g., MySQL's enterprise upsell). Self-funding favors minimal ops overhead—stick to databases that run on commodity hardware without needing expensive clusters early on.
- **Performance considerations**: RuneFrame's mix of structured (rules, inventories) and semi-structured (AI memories, homebrews) data favors databases with hybrid capabilities like PostgreSQL. For a startup, prioritize ease of scaling without over-engineering.
- **EULA mindfulness**: Permissive licenses (PostgreSQL, SQLite) offer the most freedom, avoiding GPL/SSPL pitfalls that could force open-sourcing proprietary IP. This aligns with community contributions without mandates.
- **Open-source community fit**: Databases like PostgreSQL and MariaDB have vibrant ecosystems where the team can contribute bug fixes, extensions, or integrations (e.g., TTRPG-specific schemas), building goodwill.

### Backend Recommendation
For a cost-effective, high-performance backend that's entirely free and open-source-friendly, I recommend **PostgreSQL as the core database**, paired with a lightweight server framework to keep things simple and maintainable for a small team. This setup emphasizes zero commercial costs, strong community support for contributions, and excellent performance for RuneFrame's needs.

- **Why PostgreSQL?** It's the best balance: Fully free, permissive license (no EULA gotchas), superior performance for complex TTRPG data (e.g., relational tables for rules + JSON for flexible content), and scalability from startup to growth. It's battle-tested in gaming platforms (e.g., similar to how Discord or Steam handles user/game data). The team can contribute extensions (e.g., custom functions for rule balancing) to the PostgreSQL community, aligning with their ethos.
  
- **Full Backend Stack Suggestion** (All Free/Open-Source):
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL (self-hosted on a VPS like DigitalOcean or Linode for ~$5/month initial).
  - **Server Framework**: Use **FastAPI (Python)** for the API layer—it's fast, easy to learn, and handles async operations for real-time features like AI updates. Alternatives: **Express.js (Node.js)** if the team prefers JavaScript for full-stack consistency with potential front-end tools.
  - **Additional Tools**:
    - **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (Python) or Prisma (Node.js) for easier database interactions without raw SQL.
    - **Caching**: Redis (free, open-source) as a lightweight add-on for session management or real-time sync, if needed.
    - **Authentication**: Integrate with open-source libraries like JWT or OAuth2 (no need for paid services like Auth0).
    - **Deployment**: Docker for containerization (free), hosted on a single cheap server initially. Use free CI/CD like GitHub Actions for contributions and testing.

This stack keeps total costs under $10-20/month for hosting, with no licensing fees. It supports high performance (e.g., low-latency queries for mobile), allows easy community contributions (e.g., open-sourcing custom PostgreSQL extensions for TTRPG tools), and scales as users grow. Start with a proof-of-concept on local machines to validate, then migrate to cloud. If the platform evolves to heavy document storage, hybridize with PostgreSQL's JSON features rather than switching to NoSQL.

If the team's expertise leans toward a different ecosystem (e.g., MySQL familiarity), MariaDB is a solid fallback. Avoid MongoDB due to EULA complexities unless flexibility outweighs the risks. Let me know if you'd like a deeper dive into implementation or alternatives!
