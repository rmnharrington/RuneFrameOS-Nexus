# **Verifiable Digital Trust: A Strategic Framework for Data Provenance, Attestation, and Security in the Modern Gaming Ecosystem**

## **Introduction: The New Frontier of Digital Trust for Storytellers**

The digital landscape is undergoing a fundamental transformation, moving away from perimeter-based security models toward architectures of intrinsic trust. For an organization like RuneFrameOS, whose foundational mission is to empower storytellers by providing "the most expansive and customizable tabletop gaming engine ever built," this shift is not merely a technical upgrade; it is a strategic imperative.1 The company's philosophy, "We believe the only thing you should need to tell an epic story... is the will to tell it," presupposes an environment of profound trust—a space where creators feel secure in sharing, integrating, and building upon each other's work without fear of theft, manipulation, or unauthorized use.1 Traditional security paradigms, designed to protect monolithic corporate assets from external threats, are fundamentally inadequate for the dynamic, decentralized, and collaborative ecosystem RuneFrameOS envisions. An ecosystem built to "seamlessly integrate any homebrew rule system with others" requires a new security philosophy, one that is as innovative and "outside the box" as the creative ethos of its parent company, Bad Guy Gas Productions.1

This report posits that for a "privacy first and security by design" company, establishing and maintaining verifiable digital trust is a core product feature, not a background function \[User Query\]. The modern threat landscape for a gaming platform is multifaceted, encompassing the theft of user-generated intellectual property (IP), sophisticated cheating mechanisms that erode fair play, breaches of sensitive player personally identifiable information (PII), and the gradual decay of user confidence in the platform's integrity. To counter these threats, this report introduces two emerging and powerful concepts: Data Provenance and Data Attestation. These are the technical pillars upon which a new generation of digital trust can be built. Data Provenance provides an immutable, verifiable history of every piece of data, while Data Attestation offers cryptographic proof of an entity's identity and state at a specific moment in time.

The value proposition of RuneFrameOS is inextricably linked to the empowerment of its users and the seamless integration of their content.1 This creates a unique and complex data security challenge that is fundamentally different from traditional enterprise environments. The platform is not merely protecting its own corporate data; it is acting as a trusted custodian for the creative output and intellectual property of its entire user base. Consequently, security cannot be an opaque, back-end process. It must be a visible, verifiable feature that gives users tangible confidence in the platform's integrity. The adoption of a security framework grounded in provenance and attestation is not just a defensive measure; it is an essential component of the user experience and the brand's core promise. The bold motto of Bad Guy Gas—"we don’t just think outside the box — we set it on fire, roll for initiative, and pitch the ashes as transmedia IP"—signals a readiness to embrace such a paradigm-shifting approach to security.2

This report will navigate this new frontier by providing a comprehensive analysis designed to inform strategic decision-making. It begins by establishing a deep understanding of Data Provenance and Data Attestation as foundational concepts. It then explores their practical application in the form of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) for supply chain integrity and robust Data Classification methodologies. Following this, the report presents a unifying architectural philosophy—a data-centric application of Zero Trust principles—that synthesizes these elements into a cohesive strategy. Finally, the report culminates in a set of specific, actionable recommendations tailored for RuneFrameOS, its parent company Bad Guy Gas, and the broader gaming industry, providing a roadmap to build the next generation of trustworthy digital ecosystems.

## **Data Provenance: Establishing an Immutable Record of Creation**

At the heart of any system built on trust is the ability to answer fundamental questions about its data: Where did it come from? Who created it? What has happened to it since its creation? Data Provenance provides the framework for answering these questions with verifiable certainty.

### **Defining the Pedigree of Data**

Data Provenance is the historical record of data, detailing its origins and capturing its metadata as it moves through various processes and transformations.3 It is the "chronology of the origin, development, ownership, location, and changes to a system or system component and associated data".5 In essence, provenance provides the pedigree of data, answering the critical questions of

*who* created it, *when*, *where*, *why*, and *how* it was produced and subsequently modified.3 This meticulous documentation of a data asset's lifecycle is primarily concerned with establishing authenticity and integrity, which in turn builds the trustworthiness required for confident reuse and analysis.3

A crucial distinction must be made between Data Provenance and the related concept of Data Lineage. While often used interchangeably, they serve different purposes.9 Data Lineage tracks the

*path* or *flow* of data through systems, focusing on *how* it moves and transforms. It is a dynamic map primarily used for operational tasks like optimizing data pipelines and debugging errors.3 Data Provenance, in contrast, is a historical, contextual record focused on the data's origin and authenticity. It is a static record of the data's history, essential for audit, forensic analysis, and verifying trustworthiness.3 For a platform like RuneFrameOS, lineage helps ensure a game asset moves correctly from the creation tool to the game engine, while provenance proves who created that asset and that it has not been tampered with since.

| Feature | Data Lineage | Data Provenance |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Question** | How did the data get here? What was its path? | Where did this data come from? Who created it and why? |
| **Focus** | Data flow, movement, transformation, and dependencies. 9 | Data origin, history, authenticity, and context. 3 |
| **Nature** | Dynamic map of the data's journey. 9 | Static, historical record of the data's background. 9 |
| **Primary Use Case** | Operational efficiency, pipeline optimization, impact analysis, debugging. 3 | Trustworthiness, data quality assessment, auditability, regulatory compliance, forensic analysis. 7 |
| **Analogy** | A package's shipping tracker showing its route. | A certified document detailing an artifact's chain of custody and origin. |

### **The Provenance Lifecycle and Technology Stack**

The process of recording and managing provenance can range from simple to highly sophisticated. In its most basic form, provenance can be documented in a plain text README file that describes data collection methods.6 However, for robust, scalable systems, more structured and automated approaches are necessary. Provenance information is metadata that can be recorded using generic schemas like Dublin Core or, more powerfully, with specialized data models like the W3C's Provenance Data Model (PROV-DM) and its semantic web ontology (PROV-O).6

A mature provenance system relies on a technology stack designed for automated and secure metadata capture. Algorithms are used to automatically document data flow through different systems, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.3 Advanced algorithms can even detect anomalies or unusual patterns in the provenance record, flagging potential data integrity issues or security breaches. The use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is critical for enabling seamless communication between disparate systems, allowing for the automated collection, sharing, and updating of provenance information across the diverse platforms that RuneFrameOS aims to integrate.3 For creating an immutable and tamper-proof provenance trail, blockchain technology is increasingly being explored. By storing the provenance record on a distributed ledger, organizations can achieve a very high degree of confidence in the integrity of the data's history.11

### **State of the Industry and Relevance to Gaming**

Data Provenance is not a purely theoretical concept; it has found practical application in industries where data integrity is non-negotiable. In finance, it provides verifiable audit trails for transactions. In healthcare and pharmaceutical research, it ensures the reliability of clinical trial data and patient records.3 The principles of provenance are also at the forefront of academic and technological research, with recent work exploring its application in enhancing the integrity of Semantic Web frameworks and ensuring the transparency of training data for AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).13

Within the gaming industry, provenance offers significant value, particularly in the realm of game analytics. By capturing provenance data during gameplay, designers can generate visual graphs of the game flow, identify unexpected player behavior patterns, and find critical points for rebalancing difficulty or item values.19 This provides a data-driven approach to game design that is based on a verifiable record of actual player experiences.

However, the most transformative application of data provenance for a platform like RuneFrameOS lies beyond security logging or game analytics. It serves as a foundational building block for a system of verifiable authorship and intellectual property attribution. The platform's core mission involves integrating a vast amount of homebrew and user-generated content, which is a form of IP.1 A significant challenge in any UGC ecosystem is determining ownership, originality, and the boundaries of derivative works.22 By implementing a robust provenance system that captures who created a piece of content and the full history of its modifications, RuneFrameOS can generate an auditable "pedigree" for every homebrew rule, character, or campaign module.3 This technical record can show, for example, that User A created an original magic system at a specific time, and User B later adapted a single spell from that system to create a new, distinct piece of content. This transforms a security mechanism into a powerful IP management tool, providing a technical basis for resolving ownership disputes and enabling features like a trusted marketplace where creators can license or sell their verifiably original work, confident that their authorship is immutably recorded. This directly fulfills the mission to "empower storytellers" by giving them the tools to not only create but also protect and potentially monetize their creations.1

### **NIST Guidance on Provenance**

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) formally recognizes the critical importance of provenance in cybersecurity. NIST defines provenance as the "metadata pertaining to the origination or source of specified data" and, more broadly, as the "chronology of the origin, development, ownership, location, and changes to a system or system component and associated data".5 This definition underscores that provenance applies not just to data but to the very software and hardware components that process it.

This concept is operationalized in NIST Special Publication 800-53, which outlines security controls for federal information systems. Control SR-4, "Untampered Systems and Components," explicitly requires organizations to "document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance" for designated systems and data.24 This control emphasizes the need for procedures to track and document any changes to provenance, including those in the supply chain, and to ensure the non-repudiation of these records.

NIST further elaborates on this with several control enhancements that are directly relevant to managing a complex digital ecosystem:

* **SR-4(1) Identity:** Establish unique identification for supply chain elements, processes, and personnel.  
* **SR-4(2) Track and Trace:** Maintain unique identification for systems and components to enable tracking throughout the supply chain.  
* **SR-4(3) Validate as Genuine and Not Altered:** Employ controls to validate that a received component is genuine and untampered.  
* **SR-4(4) Supply Chain Integrity – Pedigree:** Use defined controls and analysis to ensure the integrity of a component's internal composition and provenance.

These controls highlight a holistic view of provenance that extends from the data itself to the software that runs it and the supply chain that delivers it. NIST's work in areas like metrological traceability for scientific data and the CHIPS program's development of a "Provenance Chain™ Network" for microelectronics further signals the growing consensus that verifiable provenance is a cornerstone of modern security and trust.25

## **Data Attestation: The Act of Verification and Proof**

If data provenance provides the historical record of trust, data attestation provides the real-time, cryptographic proof of that trust. It is the mechanism by which one entity can prove its identity and the integrity of its state to another, forming the active, verifiable core of a secure interaction.

### **Fundamentals of Digital Notarization**

At its most fundamental level, Data Attestation is the process of verifying the integrity and origin of data. It functions as a "digital notary public," providing assurance that data has not been tampered with and originates from a trusted source.27 While provenance is a key input, attestation is the active process of verification. A robust attestation process is built on several key pillars 28:

1. **Data Provenance:** The historical record of the data's origin and journey.  
2. **Data Integrity:** Mechanisms, typically cryptographic hashing, to prove that the data has not been altered since its creation.  
3. **Digital Signatures:** Cryptographic proof of the authenticity of the data's creator or signer, verifying their identity.  
4. **Timestamping:** A record of when the data was created or attested, establishing a verifiable chronological order.

The process of attestation is often described using two models: the "passport check" and the "background check".29 In this interaction, there are three key roles:

* The **Attester:** The entity providing believable information (evidence) about itself (e.g., a game client).  
* The **Verifier:** A trusted third party that evaluates the evidence against a set of policies (e.g., an attestation service run by RuneFrameOS).  
* The **Relying Party:** The entity that needs to decide whether to trust the Attester (e.g., the game server).

In the **passport model**, the Attester presents its evidence to the Verifier, which issues a signed "attestation result" (like a passport). The Attester can then present this passport to the Relying Party, which only needs to verify the passport's signature to grant trust. In the **background check model**, the Attester presents its evidence to the Relying Party, which then forwards it to the Verifier for a real-time check before making a decision.29 This process provides a strong, verifiable mechanism for establishing trust between remote and potentially untrusted parties.

### **Best Practices for a Robust Attestation Framework**

Building an effective attestation framework requires adherence to a set of established best practices designed to ensure trust, transparency, and accountability. A sound framework is built upon the following principles 32:

* **Standardization:** Use industry-standard formats, schemas, and protocols (e.g., for attestation reports) to ensure consistency and interoperability with a wide range of tools and platforms.  
* **Strong Authentication and Integrity:** Implement robust cryptographic mechanisms, such as digital signatures using recognized algorithms and digital certificates from trusted authorities, to guarantee the identity of the attester and the integrity of the attested data, protecting against forgery and tampering.  
* **Granular Access Control:** Enforce strict access control rules based on the principles of "need-to-know" and "least privilege." Only authorized individuals or systems should have the permissions to create, view, or revoke attestations.  
* **Secure Storage:** Attestation records themselves are sensitive data. They must be stored in secure, tamper-evident repositories that are encrypted, access-controlled, and maintain comprehensive audit trails.  
* **Lifecycle Management:** Establish clear processes for the entire lifecycle of an attestation, including its creation, validation, expiration, and, crucially, revocation. Attestations must be regularly updated to reflect changes in the underlying system's state or security posture.  
* **Independent Verification:** The verification process should be impartial and objective. This ensures that attestations are aligned with security policies and that the entire process is accountable and trustworthy.

### **Advanced Attestation Techniques and Use Cases**

The applications of attestation extend into the most advanced areas of cybersecurity and computing. One of the most critical use cases is in **Confidential Computing**. Here, attestation is the foundational technology that allows a user to verify the integrity of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)—a secure, isolated area within a processor, such as an Intel SGX enclave or AWS Nitro Enclave—*before* loading sensitive code or data into it.29 The TEE provides an "attestation report" that cryptographically proves its hardware is genuine and its software is in a known-good state, enabling computation on encrypted data without exposing it to the host operating system.

Beyond TEEs, attestation leverages advanced cryptographic techniques. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** allow one party to prove the validity of a statement (e.g., "I am over 18") without revealing the underlying data (e.g., their exact birthdate), a powerful tool for privacy-preserving verification.28

**Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)** enables multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their private data without any party having to reveal their data to the others, which has applications in collaborative data analysis.28

For the gaming industry, one of the most compelling use cases for attestation is in creating powerful **anti-cheat mechanisms**. Cheating software often works by modifying the game client or the underlying operating system to gain an unfair advantage. Hardware and software attestation can verify the integrity of a player's entire computing environment before they are allowed to connect to a game server. The client machine can be asked to provide a signed attestation proving that its bootloader is secure, its kernel has not been tampered with, and no unauthorized drivers are loaded.36 If the attestation is valid, the player is allowed into a "trusted" lobby; if not, they can be relegated to an "untrusted" lobby or denied access entirely.36 This makes it exponentially more difficult for common cheat vectors to function.

This approach resolves a core tension for a company that is both "privacy first" and "security by design." The platform needs to protect its ecosystem from threats originating on user devices, but its privacy commitment prevents it from deeply inspecting those devices. Remote attestation offers an elegant solution. The user's device (the Attester) generates cryptographic evidence about its own security state—such as a hash of its boot sequence—and presents it to a RuneFrameOS service (the Verifier).29 The Verifier can confirm that this evidence is valid and corresponds to a known-good configuration without ever needing to access the user's personal files, applications, or data. The check is a simple, binary question: "Is your system in a trustworthy state? Yes or No." This makes attestation the ideal technology for a privacy-conscious gaming company. It allows the platform to offer verifiable security assurances as a user choice, enhancing trust by respecting the privacy of those who may opt out of such checks while providing a secure haven for those who opt in.

## **The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM): Provenance for the Code Itself**

Just as data provenance establishes the history and pedigree of user data, a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) provides provenance for the code that powers the platform itself. It is a critical tool for understanding and securing the complex software supply chain upon which all modern applications are built.

### **Anatomy of an SBOM**

An SBOM is a formal, machine-readable record that acts as a "nested inventory" or a "list of ingredients" for a software package.37 It meticulously details all the software components, libraries, modules, and dependencies used to build an application, along with their versions and supply chain relationships.37 The widespread adoption of SBOMs has been significantly accelerated by regulatory drivers, most notably the U.S. President's Executive Order (EO) 14028 on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity. This EO effectively mandates that vendors providing software to the U.S. federal government must provide an SBOM, signaling a major shift in industry-wide expectations for software transparency.37

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has defined the "Minimum Elements" that a compliant SBOM must contain, which fall into three categories 41:

1. **Data Fields:** Baseline information about each component, including Supplier Name, Component Name, Version, other Unique Identifiers, Dependency Relationship, and Author of the SBOM data.  
2. **Automation Support:** The SBOM must be delivered in a standard, machine-readable format to allow for automated consumption and processing across the ecosystem.  
3. **Practices and Processes:** Defines the operational requirements, such as the frequency of generation (e.g., with every new build), the depth of dependency tracking, and methods for distribution and access control.

To facilitate automation, the industry has coalesced around a few standard formats for SBOMs. Understanding their differences is key to making a strategic choice.

| Format | Originator / Maintainer | Key Characteristics | Primary Use Case |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange)** | The Linux Foundation | Comprehensive and robust format. Covers components, licenses, copyrights, and security references. An ISO/IEC standard. 41 | Broad-spectrum software transparency, license compliance, and vulnerability management. Widely used in the open-source community. 44 |
| **CycloneDX** | OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) Foundation | Lightweight and security-focused. Designed for identifying risk in the software supply chain. Can describe components, services, and vulnerabilities. 41 | Primarily focused on cybersecurity use cases, vulnerability identification, and integration into security tools. 44 |
| **SWID (Software Identification) Tags** | ISO/IEC | An XML-based standard designed to be a formal record of a software product's installation state. Can be used to track software inventory and patch status. 41 | Software asset management (SAM), tracking installed software on endpoints, and verifying software integrity post-deployment. 44 |

### **The Nuanced Relationship Between SBOMs and Intellectual Property**

A primary concern often voiced by software producers is that sharing an SBOM is tantamount to "giving away intellectual property".45 This concern, while understandable, requires a nuanced examination. The prevailing view among cybersecurity professionals and government agencies like CISA is that an SBOM is merely an "ingredient list," not the "recipe" itself.45 Knowing that an application uses a specific open-source library (e.g., NumPy) does not reveal the proprietary source code, unique algorithms, or business logic—the actual IP—that dictates

*how* that library is used.45 Attackers, in many cases, can identify components through reverse engineering or other methods anyway; SBOMs simply level the playing field by providing defenders with the same information in a structured, actionable format.46

However, a more sophisticated argument, raised by organizations like Salesforce, suggests that in certain cases, the unique *combination* and configuration of components could constitute a trade secret or an attack "blueprint".45 For an innovative company like Bad Guy Gas, which prides itself on unique solutions, the specific blend of technologies it uses could be considered valuable proprietary information.2

Conversely, and perhaps more importantly, SBOMs are a powerful tool for *protecting* intellectual property. Modern software is heavily reliant on open-source components, each with its own licensing terms.43 An SBOM provides a comprehensive inventory that allows an organization to systematically track and manage these licenses. This is critical for avoiding inadvertent violations of "copyleft" licenses, such as the GPL, which could legally compel the organization to release its own proprietary source code to the public.43 For a company building a commercial platform, robust license compliance management, enabled by an SBOM, is an essential IP protection strategy.

The debate over SBOMs and intellectual property risk can be viewed as a false dichotomy. The most strategic approach for a forward-thinking company like RuneFrameOS is to embrace radical transparency. By proactively publishing a comprehensive, cryptographically signed SBOM, the company can make a powerful statement about its confidence in its own architecture and security posture. This act transforms a perceived risk into a significant competitive advantage. The message becomes: "Our product is so well-engineered and secure that we are not afraid to show you its components. Our value lies in our architecture and our commitment to the community, not in security through obscurity." This posture aligns perfectly with the "privacy first, security by design" ethos, building immense trust with security-conscious users and potential enterprise partners. It challenges competitors to meet the same standard of transparency, positioning Bad Guy Gas as a thought leader and innovator, consistent with its "think tank" identity.2

### **Strategic Value of SBOMs in Game Development**

In the context of game development, an SBOM transcends its role as a mere compliance artifact and becomes a strategic asset for managing the profoundly complex software supply chain of a modern game engine.48 A game like the one envisioned by RuneFrameOS is not a single application but an ecosystem of proprietary code, open-source libraries, third-party middleware, and user-contributed scripts.

An SBOM provides the necessary visibility to manage this complexity. For developers working in languages like C++, an SBOM can help untangle the web of transitive dependencies, highlighting libraries that are linked but perhaps not even used, prompting optimization.50 By integrating SBOM generation directly into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, security and compliance checks can be automated. Using a Policy-as-Code (PaC) engine, the pipeline can automatically fail a build if the SBOM reveals a component with a critical vulnerability or a non-compliant license, shifting security left and providing developers with immediate feedback.51 Furthermore, for a cross-platform engine that may leverage technologies like WebAssembly (Wasm) for portability, an SBOM provides crucial insight into the composition of Wasm modules, ensuring that even these lightweight, sandboxed components are transparent and secure.49

## **Data Classification and Protection: From Prevention to Inherent Security**

Before data can be effectively protected, it must be understood. Data classification is the foundational process of identifying and categorizing data according to its sensitivity and business value. This process is the prerequisite for any successful data protection strategy and highlights the architectural limitations of traditional approaches like Data Loss Prevention (DLP).

### **A Critical Review of Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**

Traditional DLP comprises a suite of tools and processes designed to prevent the unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive data from a defined corporate perimeter.52 Its focus is on monitoring data in motion, at rest, and in use, and blocking actions that violate predefined policies. However, the effectiveness of DLP has been consistently challenged by the realities of the modern IT environment.

Reports and case studies reveal numerous DLP program failure points. While external attacks are a concern, a significant percentage of data loss incidents stem from internal sources: hardware failures, software bugs, accidental deletion, and, most critically, simple human error and malicious insider threats.54 In 2023, 84.7% of enterprises experienced data loss, with an average of 15 incidents per company.56 Malicious insider attacks are among the costliest breach vectors.55 These internal threats often bypass perimeter-focused DLP controls entirely. The fundamental failure of traditional DLP is not necessarily in its tooling but in its architecture and philosophy. It is a network-centric model designed for a world with a clear perimeter, but today's data is distributed across cloud services, mobile devices, and partner networks, rendering the perimeter obsolete.52

The ultimate failure of many data protection programs is philosophical. Success is not determined by the height and strength of the security walls, but by the organization's deep understanding of the data's intrinsic value. Without this understanding, resources are misallocated, controls are applied inconsistently, and the program becomes a high-cost, high-friction exercise that ultimately fails to protect what matters most. Data classification is, therefore, the single most critical, non-negotiable first step in any data protection initiative. For RuneFrameOS, attempting to implement advanced security technologies without first completing a rigorous data discovery and classification project would lead to wasted resources and an ineffective security posture.

### **NIST Framework for Data Classification**

NIST provides a robust, impact-based framework for data classification that serves as an industry benchmark.58 Rather than prescribing rigid labels, NIST, through Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 199, guides organizations to classify information based on the potential impact of a security breach on three core objectives 58:

* **Confidentiality:** Preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure.  
* **Integrity:** Guarding against improper information modification or destruction.  
* **Availability:** Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.

For each objective, the impact of a breach is assessed as **Low**, **Moderate**, or **High**. This methodology, which also underpins the FedRAMP cloud security standard, allows an organization to create a nuanced risk profile for its data assets.58

Applying this framework to the RuneFrameOS ecosystem reveals a diverse set of data types with varying security needs:

* **Player Personally Identifiable Information (PII):** Includes email addresses, names, and payment information. A breach would have a *High* impact on Confidentiality.  
* **User-Generated Content (UGC):** Includes campaign stories, homebrew rules, and character designs. Unauthorized modification would have a *High* impact on Integrity. Unavailability would have a *Moderate-to-High* impact on the user experience.  
* **Proprietary RuneFrameOS IP:** Includes source code, development plans, and the RuleSmith™ AI model. A breach would have a *High* impact on Confidentiality and Integrity.  
* **Live Game State Data:** Includes character positions, health, and inventory during an active session. A breach would have a *High* impact on Integrity (enabling cheating) and Availability (causing game disruption).  
* **Public Forum Posts:** General user discussions. A breach would have a *Low* impact across all objectives.

This NIST-based classification must be complemented by industry-specific rating systems. For game content, this includes content suitability ratings from bodies like the ESRB in North America or PEGI in Europe, which classify games based on age-appropriateness and content descriptors like violence or gambling themes.61 For handling customer data in a cloud environment, compliance with standards like SOC 2 is essential, as it demonstrates that an organization has established and follows rigorous policies for data management, security, and availability.64

### **The Shift to Data-Centric Security**

The shortcomings of perimeter-based DLP have led to the rise of a new paradigm: data-centric security. This approach inverts the traditional model by prioritizing the protection of the data itself, regardless of where it is stored, how it is transmitted, or who is using it.57 Instead of building walls around data, data-centric security attaches security controls—such as encryption, access policies, and usage rights—directly to the data objects.65 This ensures that protection persists even if the network is compromised or the data is moved to an untrusted environment. It is a model that acknowledges the perimeter is gone and makes the data itself the new, defensible perimeter.

## **The Unifying Framework: Applying Zero Trust Principles Directly to Data**

The concepts of provenance, attestation, and data-centric security are not disparate ideas; they are integral components of a single, powerful, and unifying security framework: Zero Trust. By applying the core principles of Zero Trust directly to data, an organization can build an architecture that is inherently secure, resilient, and aligned with a "privacy first, security by design" philosophy.

### **Core Tenets of Zero Trust**

As defined by NIST and industry leaders, the Zero Trust model is built on three foundational principles that represent a fundamental shift from the traditional "trust but verify" mindset 66:

1. **Verify Explicitly:** This is the core tenet of "never trust, always verify." Every single request to access a resource must be treated as hostile. Access is granted only after the requesting entity (user, device, application) is explicitly authenticated and authorized based on all available data points, including identity, location, device health, service classification, and data classification.68  
2. **Use Least Privilege Access:** Users and systems should be granted only the minimum level of access required to perform their specific, authorized function. This principle is enforced using granular, just-in-time (JIT), and just-enough-access (JEA) policies, dramatically reducing the potential attack surface and limiting the damage from a compromised account.68  
3. **Assume Breach:** A Zero Trust architecture is designed from the ground up with the assumption that a breach is not a matter of *if*, but *when*. The focus is on minimizing the "blast radius" of an attack. This is achieved through techniques like micro-segmentation, end-to-end encryption, and continuous monitoring to detect and contain threats before they can move laterally across the network.68

### **From Network-Centric to Data-Centric Zero Trust**

The evolution of Zero Trust has seen a crucial paradigm shift. Early implementations, such as Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), were primarily focused on securing *access to applications and networks*. They replaced traditional VPNs with a more secure model but still treated the application as the resource to be protected. The true revolution, however, is the application of Zero Trust principles *directly to data objects*.

In a data-centric Zero Trust model, the data itself becomes the new micro-perimeter.65 Every attempt to read, write, modify, or delete a piece of data—whether it's a single field in a database, a specific game asset, or a user's character sheet—is treated as a distinct access request. This request is intercepted and evaluated in real-time by a policy engine, which makes an explicit, context-aware decision to grant or deny access. The fact that a user is already "logged in" to the platform is irrelevant; trust is never implied and must be re-established for every single data interaction.

This represents not an incremental improvement over traditional security but a fundamental inversion of the model. A DLP-based approach asks, "How do I prevent my sensitive data from leaving my network?" A data-centric Zero Trust approach asks, "Based on the full context of this specific request, why should this entity be allowed to touch this specific piece of data at this exact moment?" This shift from a reactive, perimeter-focused question to a proactive, granular one changes everything from system architecture to organizational culture. It requires security to be an intrinsic property of the data itself, making it a core responsibility for every developer whose code interacts with that data. For a company truly committed to being "security by design," this data-centric model is the only logical architectural endpoint.

### **Synergy in Action: Provenance and Attestation as the Enablers of Data-Centric Zero Trust**

Data-centric Zero Trust is not achievable in a vacuum. It relies on a continuous stream of rich, reliable signals to make intelligent access decisions. This is where Data Provenance and Data Attestation become the essential, interlocking enablers of the entire framework.

* **Data Provenance** provides the deep **historical context** required for policy evaluation. The policy engine can use provenance metadata to answer critical questions in real-time: *What is the classification of this data? Who is its designated owner? Was it created by a trusted user or a verified system process? Has its integrity been maintained throughout its lifecycle?*.3 An access request for data with a "High Confidentiality" classification and a provenance trail showing it originated from the finance department would be evaluated far more stringently than a request for public forum data.  
* **Data Attestation** provides the **real-time, cryptographic proof** of the state of the entities involved in the access request. The policy engine uses attestation to answer questions about the immediate context: *Is this request coming from a genuine, untampered device? Has the user's identity been recently verified with multi-factor authentication (MFA)? Is the application making the request running in a secure, attested environment?*.28 A request from a user on a healthy, attested device might be granted, while the exact same request from the same user on a device that fails attestation would be denied.

Together, these two pillars provide the necessary inputs for a dynamic, context-aware, and cryptographically verifiable access control system that operates at the most granular level possible: the data itself.

The following table illustrates how this synergistic model would apply to the specific data types within the RuneFrameOS ecosystem.

| Data Type | Verify Explicitly (Attestation) | Use Least Privilege (Policy) | Assume Breach (Mitigation) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Player PII** | Requires valid attestation of user MFA status and client device health before any decryption key is released. | Access is granted only to a specific, authorized billing microservice running in a TEE. All other access attempts are denied by default. | All PII is encrypted at rest with keys held in a secure enclave. A breach of the main application server does not expose plaintext PII. |
| **User-Generated Content** | Requires a valid client attestation before allowing an upload or edit. The creation event is digitally signed by the user and recorded in the provenance log. | The creator is granted full rights by default. Other users have read-only access. Edit or commercial rights must be explicitly granted by the creator. | The provenance log for all UGC is stored on an immutable ledger. Unauthorized changes are immediately detectable and can be reverted. |
| **Proprietary Game Logic** | The core game engine code can only be executed within an attested, secure server enclave. Any attempt to run it elsewhere fails. | Developers have access only to the specific code modules they are assigned to work on. The production environment is completely segregated. | Micro-segmentation prevents a breach in an auxiliary service (e.g., chat) from being able to access or interact with the core game logic service. |
| **Live Game State** | All requests that modify the game state (e.g., move, attack, use item) must originate from an attested client and be cryptographically validated by the server. | Players can only modify their own character's state variables. Game Masters (GMs) have elevated, but fully logged and audited, privileges. | The server continuously validates the game state against game rules, flagging anomalies (e.g., impossible character stats) that indicate exploits. |

## **Strategic Recommendations for RuneFrameOS, Bad Guy Gas, and the Gaming Industry**

The adoption of a security framework based on Data Provenance, Attestation, and Data-Centric Zero Trust is a significant strategic undertaking. It requires a phased, deliberate approach. The following recommendations provide a roadmap for RuneFrameOS, guidance for its parent company, and a call to action for the wider gaming industry.

### **A Phased Implementation Roadmap for RuneFrameOS**

A full transition to a Data-Centric Zero Trust architecture is a multi-year journey. It should be approached in logical phases, with each phase building upon the last to deliver incremental value and manage complexity.

| Phase | Timeline | Key Objectives & Actions | Supporting Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Phase 1: Foundational** | 0–6 Months | **1\. Data Classification:** Conduct a comprehensive data discovery and classification project using the NIST FIPS 199 framework. Identify and label all critical data assets (PII, UGC, IP). **2\. SBOM Generation:** Integrate automated SBOM generation (SPDX or CycloneDX) into the CI/CD pipeline. Mandate SBOMs from all third-party software suppliers. | Classification is the non-negotiable prerequisite for all data protection.58 SBOMs provide immediate supply chain visibility and mitigate license compliance risks.41 |
| **Phase 2: Provenance & Attestation** | 6–18 Months | **1\. UGC Provenance:** Design and build a system to capture the provenance of all user-generated content, recording creator identity, timestamps, and modification history. **2\. Client Attestation:** Implement a hardware/software attestation service for game clients to create "trusted" lobbies for fair play. **3\. Server Attestation:** Deploy critical backend services (e.g., key management) into TEEs and use attestation to verify their integrity. | This phase builds the core trust mechanisms. UGC provenance protects creator IP.3 Client attestation directly combats cheating.29 Server attestation secures the platform's core secrets.34 |
| **Phase 3: Data-Centric Zero Trust** | 18+ Months | **1\. Policy-as-Code Engine:** Implement a centralized policy engine to consume signals from the provenance and attestation systems. **2\. Data-Centric Access Control:** Begin refactoring critical data access patterns (e.g., reading character data) to require a real-time check against the policy engine. **3\. Continuous Monitoring:** Log all access decisions (grant/deny) to a security analytics platform for anomaly detection and policy refinement. | This is the culmination of the strategy, unifying the foundational components into a dynamic, granular, and verifiable security architecture that enforces Zero Trust principles directly on the data itself.73 |

### **Recommendations for Bad Guy Gas Productions (Parent Company)**

As the parent entity, Bad Guy Gas Productions can leverage the technical implementation within RuneFrameOS for broader strategic advantage.

* **Market the Trust Architecture:** The "Verifiable Digital Trust" framework should be actively marketed as a key differentiator. This is not just a security feature; it is a statement of values that aligns with the "privacy first" mission. By publishing white papers, technical blog posts, and presenting at industry conferences, Bad Guy Gas can position itself as a thought leader in building secure, privacy-preserving creative ecosystems, reinforcing its "think tank" identity.2  
* **Develop IP and UGC Monetization Models:** The trust framework enables new business models. The company should explore creating a marketplace for attested, verifiably-original UGC, where creators can license or sell their work with confidence. Offering "Certificates of Provenance" as a premium, value-add service for creators could generate a new revenue stream while reinforcing the platform's value.

### **Recommendations for the Gaming Industry as a Whole**

The challenges and solutions explored in this report are not unique to RuneFrameOS. The entire gaming industry stands to benefit from a collective shift towards these principles.

* **Advocate for Industry-Wide Standards:** The industry should collaborate to create open standards for UGC provenance and IP attribution. A standardized way to represent and verify the origin of creative work would foster a more interoperable, fair, and vibrant ecosystem for creators across all gaming platforms.  
* **Promote Attestation for Fair Play:** The pervasive problem of cheating degrades the player experience and undermines the integrity of competitive gaming. The industry should collectively push for the wider adoption of hardware and software attestation as the new technical baseline for fair play in online games. This would create a better and more trustworthy environment for all players.  
* **Clarify and Modernize UGC Policies:** The legal and policy landscape around UGC remains ambiguous.21 Gaming companies, in collaboration with industry bodies like the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) 77, should work to develop clearer, more consistent guidelines for developers and players regarding the rights and responsibilities associated with UGC. The goal should be to move from a posture of legal enforcement to a model that encourages and protects collaborative creativity.

By embracing these emerging fields of Data Provenance and Data Attestation within a Data-Centric Zero Trust framework, RuneFrameOS can not only secure its platform but also pioneer a new standard of trust for creative digital communities. This approach transforms security from a necessary cost center into a powerful engine for user empowerment, innovation, and competitive advantage.
