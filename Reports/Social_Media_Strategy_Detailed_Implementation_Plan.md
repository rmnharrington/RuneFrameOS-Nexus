🧙‍♂️ Tired of your NPCs being as interesting as a wet cardboard box? 

Our AI doesn't just generate characters—it creates legends. 

Watch this tiefling rogue go from "generic thief #47" to "complex anti-hero with daddy issues" in 30 seconds.

```

```
🔥 Hot take: Manual world-building is like using a typewriter for coding.

Sure, it builds character. But why torture yourself when Tapestry™ can generate a fully-realized kingdom while you grab coffee?

Save your creativity for the story, not the spreadsheets.
