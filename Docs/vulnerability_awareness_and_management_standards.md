## üéØ **Overview**

This document establishes comprehensive vulnerability awareness and management standards for the RuneFrameOS ecosystem, ensuring systematic identification, assessment, tracking, and remediation of security vulnerabilities across all components and infrastructure.

### **Key Principles**
- **Proactive Detection**: Continuous vulnerability scanning and assessment
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact, high-likelihood vulnerabilities
- **Timely Remediation**: SLA-driven response times based on severity
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All systems, applications, and infrastructure
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular process evaluation and enhancement
